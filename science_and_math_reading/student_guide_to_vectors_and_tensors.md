You can harness that power and make it work for you if you're willing to delve a
 bit deeper--to see vectors not just as objects with magnitude and direction,
 but rather as objects that behave in very predictable ways when viewed from
 different reference frames. That's because vectors are a subset of a larger
 class of objects called "tensors," which most students encounter much later in
 their academic careers, and which have been called "the facts of the Universe."
 It is no exaggeration to say that our understanding of the fundamental
 structure of the universe was changed forever when Albert Einstein succeeded in
 expressing his theory of gavity in terms of tensors.

## 1. Vectors

A tensor is the mathematical representation of a physical entity that may be
 characterized by magnitude and multiple directions. A tensor may be represented
 by an array of N<sup>*R*</sup> numbers in N-dimensional space.<br>
When you encounter non-orthogonal coordinate systems, you'll find that the
 direction parallel to one axis is not necessarily perpendicular to another
 axis, which gives rise to an entirely different type of vector component.<br>
If you express a vector in polar coordinates and then take the derivative of
 that vector, you'll have to account for the change in the unit vectors, as
 well.<br>
With the *z*-axis up, *θ* is sometimes called the zenith angle and *φ* the
 azimuth angle.<br>
Basis vectors that point along the axes of one coordinate system may be
 described in another coordinate system using partial derivatives. *r̂* =
 ∂*x*/∂*r* *î* + ∂*y*/∂*r* *ĵ* + ∂*z*/∂*r* *k̂*
