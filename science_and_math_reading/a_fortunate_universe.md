## 1. A Conversation on Fine-Tuning

Why, in the almost infinite sea of possibilities, was our Universe born with the
 conditions that allow life to arise? That is the subject of this book.
Clearly, we can consider an infinite variety of universes, each with a differing
 electron mass, and the core question of fine-tuning is what fraction of these
 could support complex life.<br>
Before continuing, there is a potential confusion with term *fine-tuning* that
 we should address. To a physicist, 'fine-tuning' implies that there is a
 sensitivity of an outcome to some input parameters or assumptions. Just like
 baking a cake, if an experiment produces some spectacular result only for a
 particular, precise set-up, the experiment is said to be *fine-tuned* with
 respect to the result. 'Find-tuning for life' is a type of physics fine-tuning,
 where the outcome is life.<br>
'Fine-tuning- is a metaphor, one that brings to mind an old radio set with dials
 that must be delicately set in order to listen to Norfolk Nights on Radio
 Norwich. This metaphor unfortunately involves a guiding hand that sets the
 dials, giving the impression that 'fine-tuned' means cleverly arranged or made
 for a purpose by a *fine-tuner*. Whether such a fine-tuner of our Universe
 exists or not, this is not the sense in which we use the term. 'Fine-tuning' is
 a technical term borrowed from physics, and refers to the contrat between a
 wide range of possibilities and a narrow range of a particular outcome or
 phenomenon.<br>
It supposes that a universe that is right for life exists because there are
 untold multitudes of universes with different properties. In the cosmic
 lottery, we got lucky.
* Question 1: What Is Life?
* Question 2: What Is the Anthropic Principle?
* Question 3: What Is Science?

This does not sink the theory, but it does leave the door open for an
 alternative theory to better explain the data. This is what the physicist means
 by 'fine-tuned'--*a suspiciously precise assumption*. (Precision is great in
 our data, but not in our assumptions.)<br>
Small bugbear here, but some people talk about Einstein's Theory of General
 Relativity, not his General Theory of Relativity. The former is incorrect, as
 it is the theory that is general, not the relativity.<br>
Nothing in Newton's or Einstein's theory tells us the value of *G*. We have to
 ask nature, measuring from experiment. Similar constants appear in all of the
 force laws, where they are called *coupling constants*.

## 2. I'm Only Human!

What happens in a universe in which the electron and quark masses are slightly
 different?<br>
The Δ<sup>++</sup> decay also conserves what is known as *baryon number*: the
 total number of quarks minus the number of antiquarks is the same before and
 after the decay. So the proton holds a very important title: it is the lightest
 particle made from three quarks. (If baryon number is not perfectly conserved,
 then protons will eventually decy. This has never been observed, and the
 calculated timescale for such decays is many, many order of magnitude longer
 than the current age of the Universe. Here, we treat protons as stable.) The
 neutron, by contrast, decays. If left on its own, it has about 15 minutes
 before it becomes a proton, an electron and antineutrino.<br>
bosons (wuth an integer value of spin) and fermions (with half-integer
 spins)<br>
Protons and neutrons, themselves fermions, can only be found on distinct energy
 levels with the nucleus, packed in accordance with the Pauli exclusion
 principle. This explains why, while isolated neutrons rapidly decay, a neutron
 *inside* an atomic nucleus is effectively stable. It cannot decay because no
 lower engery positions are available for the resultant proton.<br>
If the electron mass (1836.15 times lighter than the proton) were within a
 factor of a hundred of the proton mass, the quantum jiggling of elctrons would
 destroy the lattice. In short: no solids.<br>
["Person of the Year" Nomination for Higgs Boson Riddled with Errors][person_of_the_year_nomination_for_higgs_boson_riddled_with_errors]<br>
The mathematical language in which the Standard Model is written goes by the
 scientifically sexy name of *quantum field theory*.<br>
The particles of the Standard Model of particle physics get their mass by
 interacting with the *Higgs field*. Note that the Higgs mechanism gives mass to
 the fundamental particles only. In composite particles, such as protons and
 neutrons, the individual quark masses make up only a tiny fraction of the mass.
 The remainder is in the form of the energy that binds the quarks together. The
 field itself can vibrate, and these waves behave like particles. The particle
 in question is the *Higgs boson*.<br>
Here's where the fine-tuning headache begins. When you add the contributions
 from the vacuum all up, the mass of the Higgs boson we should measure would be
 infinite. There is a hard upper limit, the *Planck energy*. We don't have a
 quantum theory of gravity, so extrapolating past the Planck energy (or
 equivalently, Planck mass) is pointless. Getting closer, but still a long, long
 way from the observed value (by 10<sup>16</sup>). Particle physicists' favoured
 potential solution is known as *supersymmetry*. There is no observational
 evidence for any of the supersymmetric partners. This means the supersymmetric
 partners, if they exist, must be very massive, more massive than the energy
 available at the Large Hadron Collider, our biggest particle accelerator.

## 3. Can You Feel the Force?

The electromagnetic force is 'carried' by the photon, γ. Similarly, gravity is
 thought to be carried by the as yet undiscovered graviton, G. The strong
 nuclear force is carried by the massless gluons, so named because they glue the
 nucleus together. Finally, the weak force is the most enigmatic of the four,
 carried by three massive particles: Z<sup>0</sup>, W<sup>+</sup> and
 W<sup>-</sup>.<br>
Feynman was struggling with a theory due to Paul Dirac, known as quantum
 electrodynamics (QED). QED is ambitious, bringing together quantum theory,
 relativity, the electromagnetic force and the electron. In QED, both
 electromagnetism (and its photon) and the electron are represented using
 fields. / Most physicists believe that we can extend this picture to include
 gravity, with the force of gravity conveyed by the *graviton*. However, refusal
 of gravity to play ball with the other forces of the Universe is a major
 stumbling block in modern physics, as we will see.<br>
The coupling constants tell us the probability that a force particle will be
 exchanged.
