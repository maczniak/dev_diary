Einstein was a genius, yet it took even him ten years to progress from special
 to general relativity.<br>
In February 2016, LIGO physicists announced they had observed gravitational
 waves from the merger of two black holes. Following that historic discovery, I
 felt duty-bound to provide more coverage than my original few lines--hence the
 new short chapter.<br>
Light and free particles follow 'shortest distance' paths, called geodesics,
 through spacetime determined by how the spacetime is curved. In the appropriate
 circumstances, general relativity approximates both to special relativity and
 to Newtonian gravitation.

## 1. Foundation mathematics

Apart from a single mention of the 'most beautiful theorem in mathematics' we
 don't use complex numbers in this book. The square root of 36 is ±6. If we
 square Δ*x*, we write this as Δ*x*<sup>2</sup>.<br>
Radians allow us to use real numbers in the trigonometric functions, rather than
 degrees, which are an arbitary angular measurement. The use of real numbers in
 trigonometric functions is essential in more advanced mathematics, calculus for
 example.<br>
*e* = lim<sub>n→∞</sub>(1 + 1/n)<sup>n</sup><br>
*e*<sup>x</sup> = lim<sub>n→∞</sub>(1 + x/n)<sup>n</sup><br>
Euler's identity, *e*<sup>*i*π</sup> + 1 = 0
