## 3. Newton's Law I

If Newton's law of inertia works for you, you are called an *inertial observer*
 and your frame of reference is called an *inertial frame*. You must know the
 earth is not precisely inertial. The earth has an acceleration. But the
 acceleration due to motion around the sun at speed *v* and radius *r* is *a* =
 *v*<sup>2</sup>/*r* = .006 *ms*<sup>-2</sup>, which is a very small number, say
 compared to *g*. The same goes for the acceleration due to the earth's rotation
 about its own axis, which is roughly .03*ms*<sup>-2</sup> or roughly *g*/300 at
 the equator. It's a useful concept even on the earth, because the earth is
 approximately inertial.<br>
You should know at all times how you measure anything that enters your theory or
 calculation. If not, you are just doing math or playing with symbols. You are
 not doing physics. This discussion (using a spring) also tells you that the
 mass of an object has nothing to do with gravitation but with how much it hates
 to accelerate in response to a force.<br>
free-body diagrams<br>
Every [massless] spring/rope is pushed or pulled by equal and opposite forces
 ±*F* at the two ends since otherwise it would have *a* = *F*/0 = ∞.

## 4. Newton's Law II

You might expect more fiction because there's more contact. But that is not so,
 for reasons not readily explained within our elementary treatment.<br>
I use *μ<sub>s</sub>*, the static coefficient, and not *μ<sub>k</sub>*, the
 kinetic one, even though the car is moving, because we are discussing the force
 in the radial direction and the car has no velocity in that direction, unless
 it is skidding.
