A formal definition of the real numbers was eventually provided by the German
 mathematician Richard Dedekind, using the idea of what is now called a
 *Dedekind cut*.<br>
*Algebraic numbers* (generalizing the rational numbers) are numbers that are
 solutions to polynomial equations with integers as coefficients. Numbers that
 are not algebraic are called *transendental* (e.g., Σ1/10<sup>i!</sup>, π,
 2<sup>√2</sup>, e<sup>π</sup>)---as Euler remarked, they 'transcend the power
 of algebraic methods'. We still don't know whether e + π, πe, and π<sup>e</sup>
 are algebraic or transcendental.
