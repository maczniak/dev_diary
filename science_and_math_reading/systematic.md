 in New York City, where he used supercomputer simulations to study the
 mechanisms by which pharmaceutical drugs work.

Systems biology--the study of connected groups of biological parts that all work
 together--is relatively new. For example, the Harvard Systems Biology Ph.D.

### Chapter 2: Déjà Vu All Over Again: *The Common Patterns and Principles of Natural Systems*

They found that certain sets of three or four components appeared far more often
 in the real networks than in randomly generated networks. Alon and his
 colleagues call these repeated small patterns "network motifs."

It seemed that the feed-forward loop often made an appearance in systems that
 process information--whether that was a bacterial cell decoding signals from
 its environment in order to move toward food, or a laptop interpreting a user's
 keystrokes. In the case of the feed-forward loop, one possible use for the
 motif is to help the network deal with noise.<br>
*E. coli* senses lactose through a protein that normally grabs on to the DNA at
 a specfic spot. This part of the DNA contains the gene that tells the cell how
 to make the lactose-digesting enzyme, β-gal. When this protein is attached to
 this bit of DNA, the cell can't make β-gal. But when lactose is around, the
 protein grabs on to lctose and changes its shape. That shape change prevents
 the protein from biding to the DNA, allowing β-gal production. The second
 branch works in a similar way to the lactose-sensing branch. The cell senses
 whether glucose is available using a protein called CAP, which norammly helps
 turn on β-gal production. But glucose's presence depletes a signaling molecule
 that CAP normally grabs on to in order to function properly. Without that
 signaling molecule, CAP doesn't work and the enzyme isn't made.<br>

The amino-acid-carrier molecule will come along and bind to the sequence, and
 then it will sit around for a little bit before the final bond can be made to
 add the amino acid to the end of the growing protein chain. This "finalization"
 process takes a relatively long time, and it's that delay that improves the
 accuracy of the protein-making process considerably.<br>
Biological clocks can be exceedingly simple. In fact, the core of one such
 system from cyanobacteria is so simple that we can isolate the three proteins
 that make up the clock and put them in a test tube, and they will merrily go on
 keeping time for days. This circadian clock centers on a protein called KaiC.
 The protein is modified by two other proteins, KaiA and KaiB, that add a small
 chemical marker onto KiaC or remove that marker. In the test tube as in the
 cyanobacteria, the percentage of the KaiC protein that is modified oscillates,
 peaking approximately every 24 hours.

Ideally, hemoglobin would be able to hold on to oxygen tightly in the lungs and
 give it up easily when it is near a cell that needs oxygen. The real problem is
 that hemoglobin is just a dumb molecule. To implement its strategy, hemoglobin
 employs four pieces, called subunits, all of which communicate with one
 another. Each subunit holds on to one oxygen molecule. When one piece grabs
 onto an oxygen molecule, it makes the other pieces of that hemoglobin bind more
 tightly to oxygen than they would have otherwise. But not all animals transport
 oxygen this way. For example, some arthropods and mollusks use a molecule
 called hemocyanin, which in some species doesn't have the same cooperative
 oxygen binding behavior. This makes their oxygen carrying capacity
 significantly less efficient than ours. In this case, evolution may accept this
 decreased efficiency in exchange for better performance at extreme
 temperatures.

### Chapter 3: America's Next Top Mathematical Model: *Understanding Complex Systems Sometimes Requires Math*

In 2014, Daniel Needleman, an associate professor of applied physics and of
 molecular and cellular biology at Harvard University, and Jan Brugués, a
 postdoctoral fellow in Needleman's lab, developed a mathematical model of the
 spindle that answers questions like these. The researchers made careful
 measurements of the density of the spindle and how the fibers are oriented,
 among other things, and they used physics inspired by that which has previously
 been used to describe the material that drives the LCD screens.

This mixing process can also sometimes make an otherwise stable system exhibit
 dynamic behavior. This destabilization, known as the Turing instability, can
 produce complex patterns. Broadly speaking, the sheep-wolf field is a type of a
 general class of systems called reaction-diffusion systems. By using a marker
 that lights up under a microscope, scientists can look at a developing limb and
 see stripes of the finger-making molecule, and some scientists think that a
 reaction-diffusion system forms those stripes.<br>
Another simple model with complex behavior comes to biology from physics: the
 Ising model. The appearance of these patches is known as a "phase transition,"
 and its similar to the phase transition that happens when water freezes. The
 Ising model is one of the simplest models that displays such a transition. In
 biology, the Ising model and other similar frameworks have been used to
 describe many different systems. When it's used to model networks of neurons,
 ... Ising-like models have been used to study how proteins in the cell membrane
 communicate with one another, and they have been used to describe small
 molecules binding to long chains, such as the proteins that form a cell's
 structural skeleton.

Take the model that some scientists built for the tiny organism *Mycoplasma
 genitalium*, for example. *Mycoplasma* is a comparatively simple organism. It's
 composed of a single cell with only 525 genes. The researchers, led by Markus
 Covert, associate professor of bioengineering and of chemical and systems
 biology at Stanford University, built a mathematical model of how the whole
 cell works. Essentially, they took the processes that they thought were most
 important in the cell and broke them down into 28 different, smaller models.
 These little models were simulated independently for short periods. Then those
 smaller models were all allowed to influence one another, and the process was
 repeated many times. When simulated, the model does things that resemble what a
 real cell does. The model misses many of the finer details, though. By looking
 at other proteins in their model that might be able to compensate for this
 loss, the researchers were able to predict that their parameter estimates for
 these compensating enzymes were incorrect.

But there's a general challenge that scientists must deal with as models get
 bigger and bigger--a challenge that's common to all models. Every time we add
 something new to the model, we introduce more flexibility. In modelling,
 flexibility increases the range of behaviors the model can predict, which makes
 it more likely that you can produce the right behavior with the wrong
 model.<br>
The *Mycoplsma* model, for example, has about 1,900 parameters that describe
 everything from the speed of chemical reactions to the total amount of DNA in
 the cell. It's impossible to get all of the parameters right in a model that
 large. It's not even clear that there's a single "right" value for all
 parameters. Many cellular parameters vary with temperature, pH, and cellular
 context, so the correct values may depend on the current conditions. A report
 that average value of that parameter across a whole population of cells,
 scientists might accidentally choose a medium value for A when modeling those
 cells, even though no single cell actually has that value.<br>
Not all parameters are equally important to the ultimate behavior of the system,
 however. If we increase parameter X but compensate by decreasing parameters Y
 and Z, we may have a relatively small effect on the system's behavior: this is
 called a "soft" combination of parameters because the system is broadly
 insensitive to changes of this type. On the other hand, a model is very
 sensitive to changes of "stiff" combinations of parameters. In many large,
 real-world systems, a fortuitous simplification tends to occur: only a handful
 of parameter combinations are stiff. This pattern holds for systems as diverse
 as systems of proteins, a variation of the Ising model, and networks of
 neurons. This simplification allows scientists to make predictions about how a
 model should behave, even when they don't know all of the parameters. Besides
 increasing our ability to study large systems, thinking about stiff parameters
 sets allows us to get at the crux of a system's overall behavior: Which parts
 and which interactions are actually important?

### Chapter 4: Ignoring the Devil in the Details: *Robustness, Prediction, Noise, and the General Properties of Systems*

A robust system--one whose overall behavior is insensitive to the details of its
 parts--has a clear advantage: it can tolerate unexpected imperfections in the
 system without falling apart entirely. Scientists have studied many aspects of
 the "run and tumble" behavior, including its ability to adapt. In this context,
 adaptation means that the bacterium becomes accustomed to different smell
 strengths. This property of adaptation turns out to be robust.<br>
Indeed, one such insulin pump received FDA approval in September 2016. It is
 difficult to get those machines to perform as well as the body's own system.
 There's another possible solution to glucose management in type 1 diabetics:
 replacing the insulin-releasing beta cells that the immune system destroyed.
 They can take cells isolated from a patient's body, then add many different
 rounds of chemical signals to prod the cells to change into beta cells. After
 weeks of treatment, those cells are able to produce insulin. If scientists
 could find a way to insert these beta cells into the body of a patient with
 type 1 diabetes and to protect them from the immune system attacks that killed
 the body's original beta cells, ...<br>
One of the most impressive things about biological systems is that they function
 so well despite how messy they are on a molecular level.<br>
For any sustem like this, scientists from the University of Cambridge and
 Harvard University have proved a mathematical limit on how precise the feedback
 can be--no matter what happens in the box with the question mark! The short
 version of their result is that noise is very difficult to reduce: every time
 the cell wants to double the precision of this feedback loop, it must spend at
 least 16 times as much energy as before by making protein 16 times faster. To
 improve the precision ten-fold, it would have to spend at least 10,000 times as
 much energy. And while there aren't too many mathematically provable laws in
 biology, this is one of them.

> suppression of molecular flunctuations." *Nature* 467, 174-78 (2010)

Scientists have made calculations of how much information each cell can get from
 the signaling molecules available to it, and it looks like in some cases the
 fly may use almost all of the information available to it.
> Gregor, T., et al. "Probing the limits to positional information." *Cell* 130,
> 153-64 (2007)

Despite the fact that biology is constantly fighting against noise and
 randomness, living things occasionally can harness noise to do something
 useful. Noise can be useful for biological systems because it keeps them from
 being boring--and in the cutthroat world of biology, being boring can sometimes
 get an entire population killed. Some cells have evolved to harness noise to
 produce this kind of diversity in a system's response to a given input. As it
 turns out, a few cells survive each round of antibiotics simply because they
 had been preparing for disaster. These survivors are known as persister cells,
 and we can think of this phenomenon as the bacteria hedging their bets at the
 population level.

In these models, the drivers follow some very simple rules, for example: (1)
 don't run into other cars and (2) if you're going less than the speed limit and
 there's space in front of you, speed up. But if everyone behaves this way,
 traffic jams emerge when there are too many cars on the road. A small variation
 in the speed of one section of cars or a few people braking suddenly can cause
 waves of traffic to bunch up behind them. This kind of emergent group behavior
 also appears in many biological contexts: fish swim in a coherent school, birds
 flock away from a predator, and ants forage for food. These kinds of phenomena
 are often called emergent or collective behaviors.

Distinguishing among these models requires careful study; it's hard to show that
 the system is actually following the model's rules rather than some other sets
 of rules that lead to similar overall behaviors.

## PART II: CELLS, ORGANISMS, AND ECOSYSTEMS

### Chapter 5: Beyond Tim Hanks's Nose: *Sequencing Technology Is Enabling Scientists to Study All of a Cell's Genes at Once*

In fact, until relatively recently it seemed that there was no practical way to
 take a specialized cell such as a skin cell and turn it back into a pluripotent
 stem cell. But in 2006, Shinya Yamanaka and Kazutoshi Takahashi, researchers at
 Kyoto University, were able to "reprogram" normal, adult skin cells into
 pluripotent stem cells. After painstakingly trying many different candidate
 genes, Yamanaka and Takahashi eventually came up with a set of just four genes
 that were sufficient to "reset" regular, adult cells and turn them back into
 pluripotent stem cells. Cells that have been reprogrammed in this way are known
 as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells). Yamanaka won the 2012 Nobel
 Prize in Physiology or Medicine for these reprogramming efforts, and his work
 spawned one of today's hottest research topics. For example, scientists at
 Stanford University showed that they could force skin cells to become neurons
 by turning on just three genes. Growing a fully functional heart or other organ
 is still science fiction, but the technology is moving in that direction.

This is called a positive genetic interaction--when losing two genes is less
 harmful than expected. This is a negative genetic interaction: losing both
 genes together is worse than expected. One step in this direction happened in
 2010, when scientists at the University of Toronto and their collaborators
 published a paper describing the interactions among more than 5 million pairs
 of yeast genes. [Cytoscape][cytoscape], [YeastMine][yeastmine]

### Chapter 6: The Smells of the Father: *RNA, DNA Margin Notes, and the Other Missing Parts of the Cellular System*

Fetuses that have an extra copy of most other chromosomes usually don't even
 survive to birth. But a person with extr copy of the X chromosome is a woman.
 If it were active, that X chromosome would cause chaos, but by wrapping up the
 exta X (a Barr body), females are able to inactivate the genes of that
 chromosome. Interestingly, the decision of which X chromosome to inactivate
 seems to be more or less random, so women actually are mosaics of cells. This
 is how calico cats get their patchy patterning. Indeed, one of them major parts
 responsible for inactivating the X chromosome is a large RNA molecule called
 X-inactive specific transcript (Xist), which coats the chromosome by spreading
 out along the DNA.<br>
Water fleas have about 31,000 genes. Rice has 51,000 genes. The organism that
 causes the sexually trasmitted infection trichomoniasis has 60,000 genes. And
 yet humans have only a little more than 20,000 genes. Scientists learned that
 while DNA is famous for encoding the information that cell need to make
 proteins, only about 1% of the human genome codes for proteins.<br>
Viruses work by inserting their genetic material into cells and hijacking them
 to make more viruses, so Jorgensen's extra copies of the "purple" gene probably
 looked a bit like a viral attack to the plant. So when the plant found
 suspicious RNA templates lying around it actually used that suspicious RNA to
 help it find and destroy other templates that look like the suspicious one.
 This process of turning off genes by introducing foreign RNA is known as RNA
 interference, or RNAi. Building on Jorgensen's happy accident, scientists can
 also use RNAi as a tool to suppress genes in the laboratory. In the
 millimeter-long worm *C. elegans*, for example, researchers can easily check
 the effects of turning off each of the worm's genes; it's as simple as feeding
 the worms bacteria that carry the right RNA sequence. Since a few human
 diseases are caused by too much of a single protein, some scientists are trying
 to use RNAi to treat these types of diseases.<br>
Probably the most famous type of modification is phosphorylation, which involves
 the addition of one phosphorous and three oxygen atoms to a protein.
 Phosphorylation can affect the protein's shape and thereby change how it
 interacts with other proteins, and many proteins can be phosphorylated in
 multiple places. Protein modifications can even be used as sensors of
 environmental conditions; for example, the protein hypoxia-inducible factor-1α
 (HIF-1α) seems to use one modification to sense how much oxygen is available to
 the cell. HIF-1α is modified by a protein called prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) that
 consumes oxygen in order to attach a pair of atoms--an oxygen and a
 hydrogen--to HIF-1α.<br>
Unfortunately, in about 1 in 15,000 or 20,000 children, there is a problem with
 the mon's copy of the UBE3A gene, and the child develops a disorder called
 Angelman syndrome. Scientists don't really know why the neurons silence the
 paternal copy of the UBE3A gene, but it appears that the father's copy of UBE3A
 is turned off due to a combination of methylation on the DNA and the
 suppressing action of a piece of RNA. The paternal copy of that DNA region
 isn't methylated, which allows the production of a piece of RNA that turns off
 the father's copy of UBE3A. Knowing this, some scientists are investigating
 whether we might be able to reverse the silencing process for the
 intact-but-silenced paternal copy of the UBE3A gene, thereby hopefully
 preventing the disorder. Changes in DNA methlylation, for example, appear to be
 responsible for a deficiency in oil production in the African oil palm *Elaeis
 guineensis*, the source of most of the world's palm oil. Then, in a 2015 study,
 an international team of scientists including researchers from the Malaysian
 Palm Oil Board and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory found that mantling appears to
 be caused in part by too little DNA methylation on *Karma*, a type of DNA
 element known as a retrotransposon. Retrotransposons are selfish DNA elements
 that can copy themselves into RNA, move to another spot in the genome, and
 insert themselves back into the DNA sequence in a different place. They're a
 little like proto-viruses that hitch a ride along with many living things;
 indeeed, almost half of the human genome is derived from transposable elements
 such as these!<br>
That's true in almost all cases, but there are intriguing examples where some
 nongenetic information can leak through to the next generation in a process
 called epigenetic inheritance. For this really to be a heritable odor
 sensitivity, it would have to also be there in the grandchildren of the mouse
 who was originally exposed to the odor. As far as we know, there is no
 epigenetic inheritance in humans.

### Chapter 7: Growing Pains: *How Cells and Tissues Coordinate Development, from Egg to Adulthood*

One common way is using a morphogen--a chemical signal that changes a cell's
 behavior based on how concentrated that signal is.<br>
The cells of this region, now known as the Spemann-mangold organizer, release
 signals that tell the surrounding tissue to become nervous-system-like.<br>
While all of this patterning and signaling is going on, the cells of an embryo
 are also moving around and sorting themselves into distinct groups. This
 stickiness is made possible in large part by the biological equivalent of
 Velcro, proteins called cadherins (for calcium-dependent adhesion) that sit on
 the surface of the cell. Cells from the same layer tend to have the same type
 of cadherin, and thus stick well to one another. And the ordering of the layers
 comes from how strongly two cells from the same layer stick to each other. The
 layer that consists of the cells that stick to one another most strongly ends
 up on the inside of the ball of cells.<br>
Perhaps the most important cellular movement during development is a dramatic
 event called gastrulation.<br>
Once the developing organism starts to take shape (by morphogens), some fine
 tuning is necessary. To help refine the patterns that are established during
 development, organisms use local, cell-to-cell communication: cells talk
 directly to their neighbors and come to some mutually exclusive decision, for
 example. One common way that cells talk to one another locally is using a
 protein called Notch. This type of signaling is basiclly two cells shouting at
 each other. Notch can be used to create sharp boundaries, such as the line
 between a vein and other cells in a fruit fly's wing. In human, it plays a role
 in making the liver, the heart, the immune system, the nervous system, and
 countless other tissues.

### Chapter 8: No Organism Is an Island: *The Interactions between Individuals and Species that Shape Ecosystems*

This cooperative behavior, called symbiosis, allows both species to thrive. To
 tell if it is alone or in a group, the bacterium relies on a process called
 quorum sensing. Each bacterium is constantly giving off a chemical, called an
 autoinducer, that tells other bacteria of the same type, "Hey, I'm here." In
 order to ensure that all of the individual bacteria start to glow at the same
 time, the bacteria employ a feedback loop. For example, consider
 *Staphylococcus aureus*, sometimes just called Staph. Staph uses a
 quorum-sensing mechanism to coordinate its attack and synchronize its virulent
 behaviors. Accumulation of the autoinducer caused by large numbers of the
 bacteria stimulates the production of toxins designed to hurt the host.
 Scientists hope that by disrupting this communication--perhaps by blocking the
 autoinducer signal--we might be able to develop new kinds of treatments for
 diseases that rely on this communication. To fight against Staph, some
 scientists have worked toward one day training the immune system to target
 these bacterium-to-bacterium signals directly. In other bacterial species,
 quorum sensing is used to coordinate spore production and to govern when they
 should produce antibiotics to kill off competing species of bacteria. Quorum
 sensing even helps produce dental plaque; the bacteria in the mouth coordinate
 to cooperatively manufacture a bacteria-friendly environment, called a biofilm.
 And while biofilms are pleasant homes for bacteria, they contribute to the
 formation of cavities and gum disease: removing biofilms is a major reason for
 brushing teeth.<br>
In more complex organisms, we call the chemicals tht one individual gives off to
 influence the behavior of another individual "pheromones." Pheromones are used
 for all kinds of communication: butterflies use them to signal a willingness to
 mate; aphids use them to sound the alarm when attacked; and dogs and cats use
 pheromones in their urine to mark their territory. For mice, urine-carried
 pheromones might play an additional role: these pheromones might be used to
 identify relatives and avoid inbreeding. The ant foraging behavior is also
 governed by pheromones in many species.<br>
Occasionally, signals meant for one animal can accidentally affect other
 species. During a study that lasted seven years, researchers introduced tiny
 amounts of estrogen--a few parts per trillion--into Lake 260, bringing it to
 estrogen levels similar to what is observed in waters near waste treatment
 plants. Male fish that were exposed to this estogen-laced water became
 feminized and expressed high levels of a protein called VTG that is normally
 associated with egg development in female fish. The male fish even developed
 early-stage eggs in their testes. As a result of these perturbations, the
 minnow population crashed. Less drastic but still-troubling effects have been
 observed in human population; chemicals that disrupt the endocrine system can
 alter the timing of puberty, among other effects.<br>
Whether or not plague spreads throughout the gerbil population depends on how
 effectively it can hop from burrow to burrow--and this is related to a physics
 problem: the question of percoltion. The threshold represents a sharp
 transition from never percolating to always percolating.<br>
Scientists may have a way of eliminating some invasive species. The potential
 strategy rests on the idea of "gene drives"--a sequence of DNA that scientists
 could design to spread very rapidly throughout a population. A gene drive makes
 this process nonrandom; a gene drive makes sure that it is the one chosen to be
 passed to the offspring. There are many different ways one might try to build a
 gene drive, but the topic is currently popular because scientists can now do it
 fairly easily using a new DNA-editing technology called CRISPR (clustered
 regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats). Derived from a primitive
 bacterial immune system, CRISPR allows scientists to easily program a cell to
 modify certain sequences of DNA. A CRISPR-based gene drive actually attacks the
 other copy of the gene and inserts itself in place of that copy. Scientists
 could someday use a gene drive to remove an invasive plant or animal species by
 introducing a gene drive into the population that carries a detrimental bit of
 DNA--for example, a gene that causes all of the offspring to be male, or a
 sequence of DNA that produces proteins that cause infertility. Scientists can
 genetically enginner mosquitoes to be resistant to malaria.<br>
The most famous mathematical model of interactions between organisms was
 developed independently by two mathematicians in the 1910s and 1920s. The
 first, a mathematician named Alfred Lotka, was woring on a technique that was a
 precursor to some of the mathematical models scientists use today. Lotka's
 technique involved describing a system using a set of differential equations.
 This model eventually became known as the Lotka-Volterra equations, or simply
 the predator-prey equations.
> Kingsland, S. E. *Modeling Nature: Episodes in the History of Population
> Ecology.* (University of Chicago Press, 1985)

Before the 1970s, it had long been assumed that ecosystems that consisted of
 many species with many interactions among them would tend to be stable against
 disturbances, such as the loss or introduction of some animals. But in 1972, an
 Australian scientist named Robert May published a widely discussed paper that
 challenged this assumption. May proved mathematically that large systems where
 the parts are connected together at random are essentially guaranteed to be
 unstable. These ideas also have implications for the stability (or lack
 thereof) of human-constructed systems, such as the global financial system.
 More recet mathematical work suggests that networks with many of these
 predator-prey relationships may be more stable than their random counterparts.

As an extreme example: every 48 years, the Indian state of Mizoram is utterly
 overrun with rats. Scientists can trace the cause of this ratpocalypse to the
 rats' interactions with a bamboo species native to the area, which flowers and
 bears fruit every 48 years. Once the rats have eaten most of the bamboo fruit,
 the population is far larger than the normal food supply can support, so the
 rats raid the local farmers' crops. It seems that the rats and the bamboo may
 be connected together in a system that has evolved towards cyclical behavior--a
 clock. In this way, the rats might punish any bamboo that flowers out of sync.

## PART III: APPLICATIONS

### Chapter 9: Build Me a Buttercup: *Using Synthetic Biology to MAke Diesel Fuel, Programmable Cells, and Malaria Medicine*

Somewhere in Dr. John Love's lab at the University of Exeter in southwest
 Englang are tiny plastic plates filled with bacterria growing in less than a
 thimbleful of liquid. And even though that liquid is mostly just water, salt,
 and sugar, the bacteria are doing something incredible: they're making tiny
 amounts of diesel fuel. The general biodisels that we make are oxygenated, and
 that is very corrosive. Love knew that bacteria naturally produce molecules
 called free fatty acids, and these greasy compounds are chemically quite
 similar to the molecules that make up diesel. If it just had the right enzymes,
 a bacterium might be able to make diesel fuel from these free fatty acids.
 There's a huge leap to be made between making small amounts of fuel in a lab
 and producing it on the scale required for industrial or consumer use. Love's
 bacteria feed on sugar, and sugar was about five times as expensive as
 diesel.

John Love is one of a new breed of scientists called synthetic biologists who
 are approaching biological systems in a whole different way: as machines that
 we can build. Elowitz's glowing clock was a proof of concept, and it was pretty
 successful in that regard. The repressilator became a well-known early example
 of biologists building circuits in cells rather than just studying them. And
 while later work by many different scientists has refined the initial design
 and made the clock work better, this is commonly recognized as a turning point
 for synthetic biology: the prototype showed that biology was indeed something
 we could engineer.

 Technology.

Sickle cell disease is a heritable condition in which the red blood cells take
 on an altered shape that resembles a sickle. The disease arises when a person
 has two variant copies of a gene that encodes a component of hemoglobin. In
 contrast, having one variant copy and one normal copy of this gene changes the
 shape of the red blood cells in a way that does not usually effect the health
 of the person but does provide some immunity to malaria. This compound,
 artemisinin, turned out to be a highly effective antimalarial drug. Tu Youyou
 received the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this work. Jay
 Keasling, a professor of chemical engineering and bioengineering at the
 University of California, Berkeley, and his colleagues thought that there might
 be a better way of making artemisinin than extracting it from plants. Yeast
 naturally make a precursor chemical that is distantly related to artemisinin,
 so Keasling's team started there. They genetically altered the yeast to beef up
 the enzymes that make this precursor, and they reduced the levels of a
 different enzyme that uses this precursor to produce other end products. Next,
 they copied the genes from the sweet wormwood plant that produce artemisinin
 naturally, and they put those genes into the yeast that they had modified to
 produce high levels of the precursor. In 2014, after a decade of work by
 Keasling's team and others, the pharmaceutical company Sanofi began shipping
 artemisinin produced using these synthetic techniques.<br>
One potential solution might come from a modified version of the bacterium *E.
 coli*. Besides their potential use as a detector of specific toxic chemicals,
 we might also be able to use them to screen all of the chemicals the cell comes
 into contact with for properties that might pose a thread to human health, such
 as the propensiy to damage DNA. When bacteria--and essentially all other
 cells--detect that their DNA has sustained some damage, they mount a concerted
 response to try to repair the damage. Researchers can, for example, take the
 regulatory elements that normally produce a DNA damage response gene, called
 *recA*, and hook it up to a set of genes that produce light.<br>
DNA structures can already be used to make intricate designs and even tiny
 machines, like bipedal DNA "walkers" that could be used to shuttle tiny
 components around. Other DNA structures could be used to package drugs, do
 nanofabrication, or make any number of other tiny molecular machines.<br>
Irimia's social amoeba of chioce to study is *Dictyostelium discoideum*, used in
 labs the world over and often lovingly called "Dicty" by the scientists who
 study it. Dicty is a useful model for studying how cells migrate in response to
 chemical signals from their environment. This migration is really important in
 human cells, such as a type of white blood cell called neutrophils. Irimia
 explains that neutrophil mislocalization can lead to some really bad outcomes:
 "That's when you have neutrophils going into a tissue and releasing their
 enzymes like they were attacking a bacteria, and destroying normal tissue
 instead." Irimia hopes the Dicty World Race will encourage people to tinker
 with biology.<br>
Romesberg and his team started with two new bases, which they call X and Y.
 After 15 years of hard work optimizing X and Y in test tubes, it turned out
 that getting a cell to use these new bases was relatively easy. Venter and his
 team decided to do this to build the full complement of DNA needed to run a
 single cell. The genome was small--only about a million bases, compared to the
 three billion bases humans have--but it was created entirely from scratch,
 starting with just the sequence information. Venter's team took an existing
 bacterium, removed its genome, and inserted the newly created genome in its
 place.

### Chapter 10: More Than Just 86 Billion Neurons: *The Science of the Brain, and How Connections among Neurons MAke It Work*

No one is sure exactly how deep brain stimulation works.<br>
Each neuron is connected not to one or two other neurons, but to thousands--as
 many as 200,000. An individual neuron is also much more complicated than a
 simple transistor: while a transistor can only be on or off, a neuron can very
 its firing speed to create additional complexity. Some neurons don't fire at
 all, but rather send out a continuously varying signal that affects how other
 neurons behave. Plus, there are many, many different types of neurons, each of
 which responds to incoming signals and sends out information differently from
 other types--even the same neuron's responses to signals can change over time.
 To cap it all off, some scientists estimate that your brain does all of this on
 about twenty or thirty watts of power, which is less than most incandescent
 light bulbs.<br>
The Mosers (the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine) discovered a group
 of neurons that are now known as "grid cells," which define a grid over the
 rat's cage that presumably helps it keep track of its location. There are also
 other cells in the brain, known as place cells, that appear to fire when the
 animal is in specific locations. And it seems likely that these two types of
 cells are part of the encoding that allows a rat to know where it is. And some
 scientists speculate that since the Mosers' "grid cells" are some of the first
 cells to be lost to Alzheimer's disease, that may be why one of the first
 symptoms of Alzheimer's can be the person feeling lost. Wee see similar
 correspondence between the outside world and the relevant parts of the brain in
 other contexts, too. For example, the human ear detects sound by splitting it
 up into frequencies, so there are some cells that detect high-pitched sounds
 and others that detect low-pitched sounds. These neurons are arranged in a
 row.<br>
Indeed, in their experiments, two perfectly functional networks often differed
 dramatically in the details of how easily a cell fires or how strongly certain
 neurons interact with others. The behavior of the network was not precisely
 dependent on the characteristic of each neuron--instead, the overall behavior
 was robust to many changes, and there were some stiff combinations of neuron
 properties and some soft combinations. The insensitivity to detail of these
 simple neural circuits suggests that human brains might actually be quite
 different from one another while still producing recognizably "brain-like"
 activity: personality, self-awareness, and creativity.<br>
For exmple, scientists can show in the laboratory that the process of making
 some decisions can begin before the person reports being aware of having made a
 choice. Amazingly, the scientists started seeing patterns of neural activity
 that could predict which button the subject was going to press as many as seven
 seconds before the volunteer even knew he had decided on a button.<br>
In addition to spying on the decision-making process, recordings from the brain
 can be used to allow people to interact with computers or robotic arms simply
 by thinking. For example, a 2015 sutdy by researchers from Tsinghua University
 in China and the University of California, San Diego, used noninvasive
 electrical recodings of subjects' brains to allow them to spell words at
 relatively high speeds--up to about one letter per second--by simply looking at
 the letter on a screen. In other cases, disabled patients have actually been
 able to control robotic limbs using their thoughts. For example, scientists
 were able to translate the brain activity of one quadriplegic patient into
 actions of a robotic arm. One such window came from a 2005 study of Rodrigo
 Quian Quiroga, director of the Centre for Systems Neuroscience and the head of
 bioengineering at the University of Leicester, and his colleagues at Caltech,
 UCLA, and MIT. A single neuron in another subject seemed to respond to pictures
 of Halle Berry, including pictures of her in costume as Catwoman. Even more
 impressively, it responded when the text "Halle Berry" was shown, but not when
 "Julia Roberts," for example, was shown. This single neuron might be part of a
 much more complicated pattern of neural activation that means "Jennifer
 Aniston." Unfortunately, the techniques used in this study probably won't scale
 up to record from, say, all of the neurons in the brain. That's why new tools
 for studying the brain more comprehensively are necessary.

Boyden is the head of the MIT Media Lab's Synthetic Neurobiology research group.
 Since its inception in 1985, the Media Lab has played host to a wide variety of
 work that didn't fall neatly into other categories. Some of the first quantum
 computing at MIT was done here, back before it was an established field, and
 the e-ink display that you can find in an Amazon Kindle today got its start in
 the Media Lab. Even the Media Lab itself can seem out of place: it is still a
 part of MIT's School of Architecture and Planning. One of Boyden's first
 contributions to neuroscience was his work on a technique called optogenetics.
 The general idea was to turn any arbitrary set of neurons in a brain on or off
 simply by shining a light on them. Luckily, the researchers could hijack a
 virus to do the work for them. "There's a virus called AAV that basically all
 of us have--it doesn't cause any symptoms," Boyden says. That's an ambitious
 goal, to be sure, but they and many other groups are working on it. President
 Barack Obama's BRAIN (Brain Research through Advancing Innovative
 Neurotechnologies) initiative provides a lot of funding to develop more tools
 that will hopefully one day help us decipher what's happening. One other new
 tool Boyden's group is using is a microscope they and their collaborator
 Alipasha Vaziri built that can take 3D images of brains. One of his current
 focuses is devising ways to study the brain that don't assume anything about
 how it works. His lab recently published a paper describing a new technique
 called expansion microscopy that might be useful in that respect; expansion
 microscopy physically expands tissue samples so scientists can take higher
 resolution pictures of them.

The Human Brain Project is a massive effort by scientists in the European Union
 to study the brain. The project will cost more than a billion euros over ten
 years, and it involves researchers from more than 100 institutions in 2 dozen
 countries. There are 13 subprojects within the overall initiative that include
 collecting new data about mouse and human brains, building computer software
 that combines various kinds of data, and developing computer simulations of the
 brain. "What we're doing is we're building a facility, the capability, and a
 first draft brain model." In the end, they're building models not because they
 already understand it. "We're building it in order to understand."

### Chapter 11: Death and Taxes: *Aging Is Governed by an Organism-Wide System that We Might Be Able to Manipulate*

Similar signs of aging are also manifest in the millimeter-long worm
 *Caenorhabditis elegans*, though over a much briefer period. During its two to
 three weeks of life, the worm gets discolored and wrinkled.<br>
Today we know that *daf-2* and other related genes are a part of the
 insulin-signaling pathway in worms. Insulin is a small protein that acts as a
 hormone. In human, insulin tells cells to take up glucose from the blood. In
 worms, insulin plays an important role in the regulation of energy usage,
 growth, metabolism, development, and lifespan. Reducing insulin signaling in
 adult worms seems to lead to a longer lifespan by turning on genes that help
 the worm prevent or repair damage, by turning on the worm's defenses against
 bacterial infection. On other way the worm's neurons can communicate with other
 tissues to impact aging is by using a small molecule called octopamine, which
 is closely related to adrenaline. Octopamine signaling appears to affect the
 integrity of muscle cells' mithchondria. They contain specialized machinery
 that can efficiently extract energy from the cell's food. In the worm's
 muscles, the mitochondria normally exist in clean stacks that look like a pile
 of pancakes, but as the worms age, those mitochondria become fragmented and
 misshapen. When energy stores are low, octopamine signaling is turned off and
 the mitochondria tend to stay healthy. But increased octopamine signaling in
 response to plentiful energy tends to cause mitochondrial fragmentation.<br>
This regulation of aging happens across whole worms, but it occurs at a smaller
 scale, too--inside single cells. In yeast, a single-celled organism that
 displays some symptoms of aging similar to those seen in more complicated
 organisms. Postdoctoral fellow Adam Hughes and principal investigator Daniel
 Gottschling found that the cell's mitochondrial problems could be delayed by
 protecting the integrity of another part of the cell, an acidic compartment
 called the vacuole. The yeast vacuole performs many functions, including
 storing the building blocks of proteins, breaking down existing proteins, and
 helping the cell maintain the proper internal environment. When the vacuole
 starts to lose its acidity, though, the researchers observed that the
 mitochondria soon start to break down.<br>
Mitochondria communicate with the rest of the cell in mice and humans, too. For
 example, mitochondria participate in the signaling involved in cell death and
 in recycling old cellular parts for reuse. It was once thought that
 mitochondria were more or less interchangeable sources of energy for the cell.
 But swapping out one type of mitochondria for another type appears to have
 effects on learning and cognition in mice, which suggests that it may be
 possible to have mitochondria that are "mismatched" with the rest of the cell.
 And in humans, changes in the mitochondria are risk factors for conditions such
 as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia.

The increased lifespan was inherited for three generations, even though the gene
 that Greer initially got rid of in order to make them live longer was back to
 normal.<br>
All of a worm's cells stop dividing once it reaches adulthood, so it is stuck
 with the same cells for the rest of its life. Human, in contrast, have special
 cells--stem cells--that can divide to replace old or damaged cells, but not
 indefinitely. This point at which the cells stop growing is known as the
 Hayflick limit. Each of the chromosomes in a cell has a "cap" on each end
 called telomere; the telomere protects the rest of the DNA. When a cell
 divides, it loses a small part of its telomeres, and when the cap wears down
 enough, the cell stops dividing and enters senescence. On the other hand,
 senescence also probably serves an important function: keeping cells in check.
 Some amphibians, including newts and axolotls, can regrow entire limbs. Tiny
 flat organisms called planaria that are commonly found in lakes and rivers are
 sometimes called "immortal under the edge of the knife" because they can
 regenerate lost body parts seemingly without limit.<br>
The basis for the young blood trial began with laboratory experiments using a
 technique called parabiosis. In parabiosis, two mice are joined together
 surgically so that their bloodstreams become linked. When researchers joined an
 older mouse with a younger mouse, some parts of the older mouse that had
 previously withered with old age seemed to have improved.

### Chapter 12: Your Microbiome and You: *The Body Is Host to Trillions of Microbes that Affect Human Health*

The scientists were studying hundreds of pairs of Malawian twins, and these
 children displayed an odd pattern. The scientists suspected that the efficiency
 with which these children were able to extract nutrition from their food might
 be influenced by the types of bacteria living in each child's gut. About 60% of
 the dry mass of your feces is actually bacteria from your gut, so this was an
 effective way of getting at the microbes that the children were carrying. The
 scientists then took these stool samples and used them to inoculate mice that
 didn't have any microbes in their own guts.<br>
A typical adult person is composed of about 40 trillion cells, but he or she is
 host to at least that many microbes living on and in the body. These microbes
 are mostly bacteria, but these are also plenty of less-familar single-celled
 organisms. All told, microbes make up about three or four pounds of a typical
 person's weight. Most of them live in the colon and digestive tract, though
 they also inhabit the skin, ear canal, lungs, and any other space where they
 can find a hospitable environment. Some scientists would use the term
 "microbiota" to describe the collection of microbes and "microbiome" to refer
 to the total set of genetic material carried by those microbes. If the normal
 patterns of the microbiome are disrupted, things can be get ugly. If your
 microbiome contains certain types of microbes in certain proportions, they may
 affect your weight, your likelihood of getting cancer, and maybe even your
 mood.
> Sender, R., Fuchs, S., and Milo, R. "Revised estimates for the number of human
> and bacteria cells in the body." *bioRxiv* 036103 (2016)

Even worse, many of the species that live happily in the body simply won't grow
 under the typical conditions scientists use to culture bacteria in the lab, so
 we're missing most of our normal tools. Luckily, techniques from system biology
 provide a way to attack the problem. We don't have to understand everything
 about every species of bacteria in the gut in order to study the properties of
 the microbiome system. In fact, we can make a lot of progress by simply knowing
 which bacteria are present in what proportions and how those bacteria interact
 with each other. By studying how the system as a whole reacts to perturbations,
 we can learn a lot about how the microbiome impacts the rest of the body.<br>
[μBiome][ubiome] ("You Biome", from Indiegogo) uses a computational method
 described in Langille, M. G. et al. "Predictive functional profiling of
 microbial communities using 16S rRNA marker gene sequences." *Nat. Biotechnol.*
 31, 814-21 (2013). Tests like μBiome's can also provide some limited guesses
 about what kinds of general functions those microbes might perform.<br>
Most bariatric surgery involves blocking off a portion of the stomach with the
 theory that the resulting smaller stomach volume will force patients to eat
 less and lose weight. Some types of bariatric surgery also involve bypassing
 part of the small intestine, which should diminish the amount of nutrients a
 patient can absorb from her food. Studies have suggested that patients who get
 bariatric surgery often lose much more weight than their peers who didn't get
 the surgery but eat the same reduced portions of food.<br>
One downside of antibiotics is that they don't discriminate between so-called
 good bacteria and bad bacteria. Our microbiome is fairly stable to the stress
 caused by one course of antibiotics, but when sickly people receive multiple
 courses over a hospital stay, for example, their gut bacteria can end up in
 total disarray. This bacterium is called *Clostridium difficile*, better known
 as *C. diff*, and it kills more than 25,000 people per year in the United
 States alone. *C. diff* usually takes hold in patients who are on heavy doses
 of antibiotics, which eliminates its usual competitors and allows *C. diff* to
 grow out of control. Once established, a *C. diff* infection can cause nasty
 diarrhea, abdominal pain, a condition called toxic megacolon, and even death in
 very severe cases. The best way to accomplish the re-seeding is with a fecal
 microbiota transplant. Calling the procedure a "fecal transplant" is admittedly
 not the best marketing--some doctors call it a "human probiotic infusion,"
 which is at least a little better--but that's exactly what it is. The doctor
 will take a small fecal sample from a healthy donor, mix it with a saline
 solution, and infuse it into the patient's body via an enema or a tube inserted
 throught the nose and snaked down into the gut. Already, work is under way to
 make the procedure more acceptable to squeamish patients and to improve the
 consistency of the treatment by developing synthetic feces that can help
 repopulate the gut. Plus, trials are in progress that will attempt to expand
 this success to treat other types of diseases that cause an inflamed colon,
 such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD).<br>
Indeed, scientists have long known that both microbes and the gut area generally
 are constantly talking to the immune system; in some cases, the gut can train
 the immune system to recognize some things as good and others as bad. For
 example, injecting ovalbumin--the protein that makes up most of the white of an
 egg--under a person's skin normally induces a strong immune reaction. However,
 this immune response is reduced if the person first eats ovalbumin. Foreign
 substances ingested by mouth can lead to immune tolerance because the gut tells
 the rest of the body that they are not a threat.<br>
Human papillomavirus (HPV) lives in certain types of skin cells, is often spread
 through sexual contact, and can actually promote cancer development. HPV seems
 to promote this out-of-control growth by affecting the degradation of proteins
 that guard against cancer-like cell behavior, promoting cell proliferation, and
 integrating its own DNA into that of the cells it's attacking. The HPV
 vaccine--brand name Gardasil--really is a modern marvel. Since most cervical
 cancers are caused by HPV, this is very literally a vaccine that helps prevent
 people from getting cervical cancer. Some scientists estimate that about one
 fifth of cancer cases worldwide are attributable to known infectious agents
 such as bacteria and viruses. Subsequent research suggests that *Helicobacter
 pylori* also can lead to gastric cancer. It turns out that the bacterium
 doesn't grow well in the acidic environment of the stomach, but rather than
 give up and go home, *H. pylori* produces enzymes that reduce the stomach's
 acidity by making ammonia. Then the bacterium burrows through the mucosal
 lining of the stomach to reach a more hospitable environment. These two
 adaptions disrupt the lining of the stomach, leading to inflammation and
 ulcers, as Marshall showed. Even though *H. pylori* can contribute to some
 types of cancer, it might actually prevent other types. That same ammonia
 production and acidity reduction that can disrupt the lining of the stomach
 means that you also have less acid reflux, which is linked to certain
 esophageal cancers. In fact, some scientists hypothesize that the lower rates
 of *H. pylori* colonization we see in modern people, perhaps because of
 antibiotics, is the cause of a current sharp increase in esophageal
 cancers.<br>
One example of a microbe that exerts some influence over its host's behavior is
 the single-celled parasite *Toxoplasma gondii*--Toxo, for short. It can live in
 a wide variety of hosts, but its favorite host is a cat. Once inside the cat,
 Toxo undergoes sexual reproduction--something that it can do only in cats--and
 exits in the feline's feces. There it waits until it is accidentally ingested
 by another host, such as a rodent. In this mouse or rat, the Toxo travels to
 muscle and brain tissue, undergoes further development, and eventually goes
 dormant, forming cysts in the tissue. Through some as-yet-unknown mechanism,
 Toxo seems to make its rodent host unafraid of cats, or at least the smell of
 them. The scientists ruled out general olfactory malfunction by making sure
 that the mice could find food by smell just as well as normal mice do, so the
 Toxo infection seems to be causing these mice to change a deeply ingrained
 predator avoidance behavior. Additionally, the effect persisted even after the
 parasite was no longer present at detectable levels in the mouse's brain
 tissue. And recent evidence suggests Toxo does something similar in
 chimpanzees, where it seems to render them unafraid of leopard urine. Toxo,
 which can infect most warm-blooded mammals, infects many humans. About 10 to
 20% of the United States population is infected with Toxo, and the rates are
 even higher in the developnig world. Overall, about 2.5 billion people
 worldwide are infected with Toxo. Toxo can definitely be dangerous to highly
 immunocompromised people; the parasite can cause symptoms ranging from
 headaches and nausea to seizures. Toxo can also be a problem for pregnant
 mothers.<br>
Many bacteria that live in the gut produce the same types of chemicals that our
 neurons use to communicate with one another, and those chemicals could be
 sending signals to the body. When scientists fed some of these mice a bacterium
 called *Lactobacillus rhamnosus*, indicating that merely having this bacterium
 in residence in the gut could actually alter the mouse's mood. When the
 scientists cut the vagus nerve, the main communications link between the
 stomach and the bain, the effect disappeared. Other groups have found similar
 results with other types of bacteria, and gut bacteria can affect other
 processes in the central nervous system such as inflammation.

### Chapter 13: This Is Your System on Drugs: *Tweaking Biological Systems to Produce Better Medical Treatments*

Coca leaves contain a mild stimulant that feels similar to caffeine in its
 effects, and Peruvian guides are adamant that coca is the solution to any
 altitude-related problem. The active ingredient in coca tea is small amounts of
 various alkaloids, including cocaine.<br>
Drug companies spend something like two billion dollars on research and
 development for every drug that eventually gets approved. There are very few
 diseases that we really understand on the systems level in humans, and we don't
 typically want to wait until science has figured everything out before trying
 to make a drug.<br>
We might be able to design a drug that will bind on one part of the protein and
 have an effect somewhere else. These kinds of drugs are called allosteric
 drugs. Most of reasons boil down to the potential for making more effective
 drugs with fewer side effects. Because of the potential benefits of allosteric
 drugs, pharmaceutical companies are interested in searching for them
 specifically. / One of Hicks's remedies, strychnine, is most commonly known as
 a deadly poison. At low doses, though, it can act as an allosteric,
 performance-enhancing drug: it interferes with the body's signaling and makes
 muscles respond more easily. Some surgeons had taken to using a new drug,
 curare, as anesthesia during surgery, but no one was totally sure whether it
 made patients numb or simply paralyzed them.<br>
[TheFreeDictionary's Medical dictionary][thefreedictionary_medical_dictionary]<br>
Shaw and his group--D. E. Shaw Research--spent their first six years designing a
 special supercomputer that can very efficiently simulate how drugs and proteins
 work. Shaw's group solved this problem by tailoring the circuitry of their new
 machine to the types of calculations needed for these sorts of simulations.
 They called the resulting supercomputer "Anton," after Antonie van Leeuwenhoek;
 a Dutch scientist at the turn of the eighteenth century, Leeuwenhoek did
 pioneering work in improving and perfecting the microscope. In a typical
 application, Anton might simulate a biological system consisting of a drug, the
 protein it targets, the cell membrane the protein resides in, and even the
 water that surrounds it. All of the atoms in the simulation are represented as
 tiny balls. Anton essentially takes Newton's laws of motion and applies them
 over and over again. These simple rules, combined with calculations of the
 electrical interactions of charged atoms, are the core of Anton's simulations.
 Anton's molecular dynamics simulations also account for van der Waals
 interactions and some subtleties that I'm glossing over here. A typical system
 might easily contain several hundreds of thousands of atoms. It advances the
 simulation by a single time step, which is usually around 2 femtoseconds. We
 can draw this in more human-friendly form by zooming out, leaving out some of
 the atoms (water), and drawing others (ptotein) with cartoons (ribbon). Those
 rules that descrive how the atoms interact can't capture all of the details
 (like quantum mechanics) of how real molecules behave. Luckily, the rules that
 Anton uses turn out to be good enough to get some insights into biological
 phenomena.<br>
A team of scientists from D. E. Shaw Research published a paper in 2011 that
 first drew my attention to the use of molecular dynamics for drug discovery.
 In that paper, the researchers investigated drus known as beta blockers, which
 are commonly used to treat heart conditions. Beta blockers get their name
 because they bind to and inhibit the activity of proteins called
 beta-adrenergic receptors. One project that I worked on, led by Dr. Ron Dror,
 now an associate professor of computer science and molecular and cellular
 physiology at Stanford University, focuses on allosteric drugs that bind to
 G-protein-coupled receptors. GPCRs are a type of protein that sits in the cell
 membrane. The particular GPCR we studied, called M2, looks a bit like a sock
 puppet with its mouth poking out of the membrane. When signaling molecules from
 outside of the cell bind to M2, it changes shape, and that shape change carries
 a message to the inside of the cell. Depending on the GPCR, that message could
 tell the cell to grow, to fire an electrical impulse, or to commit suicide. M2,
 for instance, helps control one's heart rate, among other functions. There are
 about a thousand different GPCRs, and approximately one third of all
 pharmaceutical drugs target them, so understanding how GPCRs work is of great

That process, which drug researchers call exploring the "structure-activity
 relationship" (SAR), is time-consuming and often doesn't yield much insight.
 Instead of blindly trying many different variations of a drug to see what
 works, scientists with a full understanding of how the drug grabs on to its
 target could make considered changes: "We should put a charged group at
 position 5 because it will help the drug attach to the lysine at the 132nd
 position in the protein."<br>
Ramanan works on, among other things, building better models of human livers for
 use in drug testing. The liver is responsible in part for breaking down
 chemicals in the blood, and most drugs are carried around in the bloodstream.
 Even if the original drug isn't toxic, the chemicals that the liver breaks the
 drug down into might be. One possible solution is what some scientists call
 "organs on chips." An organ on a chip is a little plastic shell that contains
 human cells--liver, heart, brain, whatever--that are intended to mimic the full
 human organ. "Let's say you have a liver module hooked up to a heart or a brain
 module."<br>
One of the best-known examples of this is the cancer drug imatinib, more
 commonly known by its brand name, Gleevec. Scientists discovered that some
 types of leukemia have an alternation in their DNA that creates a weird fusion
 of two proteins that helps make that cell cancerous. Gleevec was designed to
 treat this specific defect by turning off the defective protein. We've had a
 lot of success with this strategy in cancer, but other diseases have been a bit
 harder to crack. One possible reason for this is that we don't really have the
 ability to personalize treatments on the level of systems yet. Some diseases,
 like autism, asthma, schizophrenia, and multiple sclerosis, are harder to
 ascribe to just one or two molecular defects that occur over and over. One
 other exciting idea is to test a drug on an artificial system made out of the
 patient's own cells.<br>
In his fantastic piece "A Note from History: Landmarks in History of Cancer,
 part 2" published in the journal *Cancer* in 2011, Dr. Steven Hajdu describes
 how we've thought about and treated cancer in the past. Beating cancer is about
 more than just treating the tumor itself. In fact, the tumor and its
 environment interact in complicated ways that make it important to think about
 the tumor and the surrounding tissue as a connected system. These fast-growing
 cells include the cells that make up the hair follicles, so patients undergoing
 chemotherapy often lose their hair. Developing a "signature" of cancer (like a
 spam filter) sounds great, but checking each cell individually for this cancer
 signature could be difficult. Here's a wild idea out of professor of biological
 engineering Ron Weiss's lab at MIT: maybe we could program all of the cells in
 the body to examine themselves, then commit suicide if they look like a cancer
 cell. What if we could make a cancer vaccine--to train your immune system to
 see your cancer as the enemy? Early results seem to point to mutant peptides as
 one player. When genes that are affected by these mutations produce a protein,
 that altered protein can sometimes be transported to the cell's surface and
 "displayed" for immune cells to inspect. Moynihan's current project involves
 attempting to treat cancer-stricken mice using an approach called combination
 immunotherapy. "There are all these different types of therapeutics that impact
 different arms of the immune system. The immune system is so connected as a
 network," she explains, so she and her lab wonder: could you stimulate it in
 different places to get synergistic effects? One way is taking immune cells out
 of the body, "training" them to recognize the cancer in the lab, and putting
 them back into the patient. In addition to looking a lot like your healthy
 cells, cancer cells try to actively suppress the immune system. A new class of
 drugs called checkpoint inhibitors coming on the market try to prevent this
 immune suppression. One of them, the not-so-memorably-named pembrolizumab, is
 used to block one of the methods that melanoma can use to suppress the immune
 response.

### Epilogue

Finally, Bonner gives some career advice: "It should be clear to any promising
 young person who wishes to solve complex problems of biology that he should
 start out by becoming, say, a physicist or a mathematician."
