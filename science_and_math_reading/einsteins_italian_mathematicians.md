## Chapter 7. The Absolute Differential Calculus

The independence of the form of equations with respect to changes in coordinate
 systems was central to Einstein's adopting differential geometry for general
 relativity. In special relativity, Einstein managed to make the equations of
 motion (and of electromagnetism) invariant in form for the class of observers
 moving with constant velocity. (This solved the ether problem, because the
 speed of light emerged from the theory as invariant for all these observers.)
 In general relativity, Einstein sought to make equations invariant in form for
 any observer, including accelerated ones. This was later known as the principle
 of general covariance. (A more mature understanding of general covariance shows
 that it does not really cover a general class of observers, since these cannot
 really be identified with coordinate systems in general. But what general
 covariance does is to establish an even more important principle of general
 relativity---that these is no prior space-time geometry, but rather that it
 arises naturally from the solutions of tthe Einstein field equations.<br>
It appears everywhere in the Charles Misner, Kip Thorne, and John Wheeler
 textbook on gravitation, for instance: choose a convenient reference frame
 (such as a "local rest frame") to write equations conveniently using tensors,
 then elevate them automatically to general coordinates because their form does
 not change.<br>
quaternions (a complex set of numbers invented by W. R. Hamilton to characterize
 a four-dimensional vector space)<br>
Levi-Civita listed some of "the most useful applications [that] arise when the
 nature of the material under consideration requires a quadratic differential
 form," as in the case of general relativity, where the very small "interval
 between two events in space-time" is expressed using a differential form. At
 that point, explained Levi-Civita, Ricci took "this differential form as
 given---that is, as absolute---and this is where the essential element of the
 new calculus arises: in the notion of covariant differentiation, which has the
 essential characteristics of ordinary differentiation, but also respects the
 invariant behavior (i.e., is independent of the choice of coordinates) of the
 system to which it is applied."<br>
Perhaps Ricci too was being utilitarian in emphasizing the value of coordinate
 invariance for its simplicity and versatility, whereas Einstein was to give it
 a profound physical meaning.

## Chapter 9. Intermezzo

Written in French, Ricci and Levi-Civita's memoir, titled simply "Methods of
 absolute differential calculus and their applications," was only translated
 into English in 1975 by the American mathematician Robert Hermann, who
 described the paper "as one of the most influential and important in the
 history of *both* differential geometry and mathematical physics."
