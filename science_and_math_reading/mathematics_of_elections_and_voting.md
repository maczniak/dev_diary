## 1. Introduction

## 2. Simple Elections I

The problem with the plurality method is that the winner might be very unpopular
 with a majority of voters. Another technique used to avoid the problems of the
 plurality method is *sequential voting*. In this scheme a vote is taken, as a
 consequence a new set of candidates is selected; then a new vote is taken. We
 shall refer to this as the *runoff method* or *plurality runoff method*. The
 two top candidates are decided by plurality vote; all other candidates are
 eliminated; then a majority vote is taken.<br>
In the real world there is usually a delay after the primary, and more
 campaigning takes place. As a result of this, individual voters' preferences
 may change. But for simplicity's sake we shall ignore this for the moment, and
 assume that every voter has a *preference list*, an order of preference between
 the candidates that remains fixed throughout the voting process. We define the
 *preference profile* of an election to be the set of all the voters' preference
 list.<br>
A number of methods have been devised that require a voter to present a
 preference list. These methods are known collectively as *preferential
 voting*.<br>
The *Hare method* or *alternative vote* system was invented by the English
 lawyer Sir Thosmas Hare in 1859. In 1871, William Robert Ware proposed what is
 essentially the same idea, so the name "Ware's method" is sometimes used. Other
 names are "instant runoff voting" and "preferential voting". This list is
 called  a *ballot*. The candidate with the fewest first place votes is
 eliminated.<br>
The Coombs rule was proposed by American psychologist Clyde Coombs as "an
 alternative to the Hare system." If no candidate receives an absolute majority,
 the cadidate with the greatest number of *last*-place votes is eliminated.<br>
Point(score) methods have often been used in sporting contests. In general, a
 fixed number of points are given for first, second, and so on. This case, where
 the points go in uniform steps, is called a *Borda count*.

The President of the United States is elected by the members of the Electoral
 College (the "electors"), who in turn are appointed using the popular vote.
 Each state is apportioned the same number of electors as the number of members
 of Congress to which the state is entitled, and District of Columbia receives
 the same number of electors as the least populous state, currently three. In
 total, there are currently 538 electors, cooresponding to the 435 members of
 the Hourse of Representatives, 100 senators, and the 3 additional electors from
 the District of Columbia. The electors pledge their support for a presidential
 nominee. Each elector then casts one vote for President and another vote for
 Vice President.<br>
If no candidate receives a majority of the electoral college votes for
 President, then the House of Representatives selects the President, with each
 state having precisely one vote. If no candidate receives a majority for Vice
 President, then the Senate selectes the Vice President, with each Senator
 having one vote.<br>
In the 2000 election, the final tally in Florida showed Bush winning that state
 by 537 votes, less than 0.01% of the Florida votes, so Bush received all 25
 Florida electors.

## 3. Simple Elections II: Condorcet's Method

In 1785 Marie Jean Antoine Nicolas Caritat, Marquis de Condorcet (콩도르세), a
 French mathematician and political theorist, proposed a technique involving
 multiple use of runoff elections. Suppose we simultaneously conduct all the
 "runoff" elections among our candidates. In elections with several candidates,
 it is very common to have no *Condorcet winner*, even when there are no
 ties.<br>
Look at all the runoffs and find out which candidate won with the biggest
 majority. Now go through this list and construct a preference order of the
 candidates. We shall refer to this solution as *Condorcet's extended
 method*.<br>
An electoral system is said to satisfy the *Condorcet winner criterion* if,
 whenever there is a Condorcet winner, then the electoral system in question
 will always choose the Condorcet winner.<br>
A *Condorcet loser* in an election is a candidate who would lose in a runoff
 against each other candidate. A voting system satisfies the *Condorcet loser
 criterion* if it can never happen that a Condorcet loser wins the election.
 Plurality voting does not satisfy this condition, but several methods,
 including the Hare system, do.<br>
Another method that Condorcet proposed, in 1793, was a technique to avoid the
 problems when there is no majority winner. The system was revived by James W.
 B̃ucklin of Grand Junction, Colorado in the early 1900s, and is now called the
 Bucklin Method or the Grand Junction System. Suppose no candidate achieves a
 majority. Then the second votes are added to the tally. As the number of votes
 has been doubled, it is possible that more than one candidate will achieve a
 majority, and in that case the one with the biggest total wins.

Several methods that *do* satisfy the criterion have been invented. These
 methods are often called *Condorcet voting systems*.<br>
One very simple system was proposed by the Scottish economist Duncan Black in
 1958. If there is a Condorcet winner, then that candidate wins the election. If
 not, the Borda count is calculated, and the Borda count winner is elected. An
 earlier method combining Condorcet's methods and Borda count was proposed by E.
 J. Nanson in late nineteenth century. First, conduct a Borda count. Then
 eliminate any candidate who receives less than the average score. This method
 was modified by the Australian astronomer J. M. Baldwin, who proposed
 eliminating only the lowest scorer at each stage. A. H. Copeland proposed the
 following method in a seminar at the University of Michigan in 1951. For a
 given candidate, consider all pairwise comparisons between that candidate and
 others. If the candidate would win in *x* cases and lose in *y* cases, then her
 score is *x* - *y*.<br>
Another method that involves breakikng an election into a number of smaller,
 two-candidate, elections is *sequential pairwise voting*. In this, several
 candidates are paired in successive runoff elections. There is an *agenda* (an
 ordered list of candidates). Position in the agenda is very important. Rather
 than elections, the sequential pairwise model is often used for sporting
 tournaments.

## 4. Fair Elections; Polls; Amendments

The term *strategic voting* means voting in a way that does not represent your
 actual preferences, in order to change the result of the election. We would
 call the resulting ballot *insincere*.<br>
We say an election satisfies the *poll fairness criterion* if there is no case
 where the result is changed by a candidate who is not one of the top two drops
 out before the final vote.
