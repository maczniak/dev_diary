### 0 Seeing Arithmetic

## I Foundations

### 1 The Euclidean Algorithm

The term "Euclidean domain" is used to describe settings in which division with
 remainder, and hence the Euclidean algorithm, is possible.<br>
Solving a Diophantine equation means finding *integer* solutions.<br>
A linear equation is called homogeneous if there are no nonzero constant terms.
