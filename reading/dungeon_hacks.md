## Chapter 2: Procedural Dungeons of Doom: Building *Rogue*, Part 1

[Classic Rogue][classic_rogue]<br>
Using Ken Arnold's curses library, they used periods (".") for floor tiles,
dashes and vertical bars ("-" and "|") for walls, plus ("+") signs for doors,
and hash marks ("#") for corridors that players could traverse.<br>
Adventurers braved the Dungeons of Doom on the loose premise of recovering a
MacGuffin called the Amulet of Yendor. Toy viewed the premise as trivial. His
hope was that players would find greater enjoyment in recounting their own
adventures.
