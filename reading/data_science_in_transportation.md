Connected cars generate about 250 gigabytes per hour, or about 130 terabytes per
 year. Google's experimental self-driving car produces a gigabyte of data every
 second, averaging roughly two petabytes of data annually. Most cars already
 have between 60 and 100 sensors for measuring critical parameters such as
 acceleration, change of direction, engine temperature, and tire pressure. By
 2020, most cars will have more than 200 onboard sensors.<br>

35,092 people died on U.S. roadways in 2015 alone. 94 percent of crashes can be
 tied to a human choice or error.<br>
