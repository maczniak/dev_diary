## 1. Lambda Calculus

alpha equivalence and beta reduction<br>
A combinator is a lambda term with no free variables.<br>
the semantics of the core language are the same as the lambda calculus. That is, the meaning of Haskell programs is centered around evaluating expressions rather than executing instructions.<br>
Normal order isn't how Haskell code is evaluated -- it's call-by-need instead.

## 3. Strings

Global or top level bindings in Haskell mean bindings visible to all code within a module and, if made available, can be imported by other modules or programs. Global bindings in the sense that a variable is unconditionally visible throughout an entire program do not exist in Haskell.

## 4. Basic Datatypes

Num - Int, (Data.Int) Int8, Int16, Integer, Float, Double, Rational, (Data.Scientific) Scientific<br>
"Julie" == 8 -- error<br>
length :: [a] -> Int<br>
there is no singleton tuple, but there is a zero tuple also called unit or ().

## 5. Types

funcIgnoresArgs :: a -> a -> a -> String<br>
funcIgnoresArgs x y z = "Blah"<br>
funcIgnoresArgs undefined undefined :: a -> String<br>
curry f a b = f (a, b)<br>
uncurry f (a, b) = f a b<br>
Prelude> let f :: a -> a -> a -> a; f = undefined<br>
[How to make *ad-hoc* polymorphism less *ad hoc*][ad_hoc_polymorphism]<br>
if a variable could be anything, then there's little that can be done to it because it has no methods. If it is a concrete type, you lose the type flexibility but, due to the additive nature of typeclass inheritance, gain more potential methods.<br>
Haskell's [type inference][type_inference] is built on an extended version of the [Damas-Hindley-Milner type system][damas_hindley_milner_type_system].<br>
With respect to Haskell, the *principal type* is the most generic type which still typechecks.<br>

## 6. Typeclasses

...

partial function vs total function

...

## 7. Functions

...

*Bottom* (‚ä•) is a non-value used to denote that the program cannot return a value or result. The two main varieties of bottom are computations that failed with an error or those that failed to terminate. (for example, `error`, failed pattern matches of partial functions, `undefined` and infinite loops)<br>
*Higher-order* functions are functions which themselves take functions as arguments or return functions as results.<br>
`enumFrom`<br>
*[Pointfree][pointfree]* refers to a style of composing functions without specifying their arguments. The "point" in "pointfree" refers to the arguments.

## 8. Recursion

Being able to write recursive functions, though, is essential to Turing completeness. We use a combinator `.` known as the [Y combinator][y_combinator] or fixed-point combinator `.` to write recursive functions in the lambda calculus. Haskell has native recursion ability based on the same principle as the Y combinator.

[y_combinator]: http://mvanier.livejournal.com/2897.html

## 9. Lists

Ranges use `enumFromTo` and `enumFromThenTo` of `Enum` type class.<br>
`:sprint` - see what has been evaluated, caution: opportunistic optimizations and polymorphism<br>
NF (normal form) implies WHNF (weak head normal form). An expression cannot be in normal form or weak head normal form if the outermost part of the expression isn't a data constructor. It can't be in normal form if any part of the expression is unevaluated.<br>
`length` is strict in the spine but not the values.<br>
A common mantra for performance sensitive code in Haskell is, "lazy in the spine, strict in the leaves."

## 10. Folds

Catamorphisms ("cata-" means "down" or "against") are a means of deconstructing data.<br>
`foldr f acc (x:xs) = f **x** (foldr f acc xs)` can be used with infinite lists. Everything is find unless the first piece (cons cell) of the spine is bottom.<br>
`[1, 2, 3, 4, undefined] -- undefined value`<br>
`[1, 2, 3, 4] ++ undefined -- undefined spine`<br>
`length $ take 2 $ take 4 ([1, 2]++undefined) -- no error`<br>
