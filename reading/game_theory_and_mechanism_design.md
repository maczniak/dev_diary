# [Game Theory and Mechanism Design][homepage] by Y Narahari, World Scientific (2014)

*Mechanism Design: How to Implement Social Goals* talk by Eric Maskin<br>
More than eight decades ago, the legendary John von Neumann played a significant
 role in the creation of two different exciting disciplines: *Game Theory* and
 *Computer Science*. Astonishingly, in the past fifteen years (1998-2013), There
 has been a spectacular convergence of the above two intellectual currents. The
 applications of game theory and mechanism design to problem solving in
 engineering and computer science applications have exploded in these fifteen
 years.<br>
(Nobel Prize in Econimic Sciences 2005) Robert Aumann and Thomas Schelling,
 (2007) Leonid Hurwicz, Eric Maskin, Roger Myerson, (2012) Lloyd Shapley, Al
 Roth<br>
Since I happen to be from a computer science department, there is also an
 inevitable emphasis on computer science based applications. Second, the book
 has a detailed coverage of mechanism design unlike most books on game
 theory.<br>
Mechanism design is the art of designing games so that they exhibit desireable
 equilibrium behavior.
