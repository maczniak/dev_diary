 The C++ Journal, The C++ Report, and The Journal of Object-Oriented
 Programming.)

Knowledge can be acquired systematically; wisdom cannot.<br>
(Part II) You will also learn why it can be useful to conceal inheritance from
 its users and when to avoid inheritance altogether.<br>
Part III explores templates, which *I* think constitute the most important idea
 in C++. The reason I think templates are so important is that they provide a
 particularly powerful kind of abstraction.<br>
We are also grateful to the people ... Brian Kernighan (who gets extra credit
 for reading the entire book twice carefully with pen in hand), ...

(This work undoubtedly would have continued for some time being just a research
 project or at best would have resulted in an HP proprietary library, if Andrew
 Koenig of Bell Labs had not become aware of the work and asked Stepanov to
 present the main ideas at a November 1993 meeting of the ANSI/ISO committee for
 C++ standardization. The committee's response was overwhelmingly favorable and
 led to a request from Koenig for a formal proposal in time for the March 1994
 meeting. -- Standard Template Library, Wikipedia)

### Chapter 0 Prelude

Once upon a time, I met someone who has worked in many programming languages,
 but had never written a C or C++ program. He asked a question that made me
 think: "Can you convince me that I should learn C++ instead of C?"<br>
Dag Br√ºck pointed out that putting efficiency first is a trademark of the C/C++
 culture.<br>
Indeed, the very notion that the state of a computation should be made explicit
 is fundamental to the whole idea of object-oriented programming. It is only a
 little too flip to say that the most fundamental difference between
 object-oriented programming and functional programming is that, in
 object-oriented programs, the state that results from a computation usually
 replaces the prior state, and, in functional programs, it never does.

## Part I Motivation

This book keeps returning to these two ideas: pragmatism and abstraction.

### Chapter 1 Why I use C++

The result of my effort to write a program without arbitrary limits was that
 most of the work in the program went into bookkeeping, rather than into solving
 the real problem.<br>
However, Bjarne Stroustrup's office was not far from mine, and we had talked
 about the language as it evolved.<br>
Moreover, I know from years of dealing with computer users that most of the
 people whose programs failed because they hadn't followed the conventions
 would blame me.<br>
There have been widely distributed C libraries, to be sure, but all the C
 libraries that I know of address specific problem domains. C++, in contrast,
 has enabled truly general-purpose libraries, where the library authors do not
 even know about the uses to which their work will be put. Such is the virtue of
 abstraction.

### Chapter 2 Why I work on C++

These chapters cover issues that differ in much the same way that using an
 automobile to commute to work differs from becoming an automobile designer!<br>
It is hard to help noticing how many of the most successful, best known software
 systems were originally the work of a small number of people. Similarly,
 surprisingly many large projects turn out to be mediocre at best. The answer, I
 think, is that unlike so many other industries, software construction has
 negative economy of scale. Most competent programmers cn dash off a program of
 a hundred lines in an hour or two, yet the total output from a large project is
 typically about 10 lines per programmer day.<br>
This communication overhead becomes serious as soon as there are too many people
 on the project to fit at one lunch table at the same time.<br>
I know that today I can easily solve problems that I would not have dreamed of
 trying when I first started programming---and I'm not alone. The tools that
 most consistently hold my interest have in common the notion of abstraction.
 Abstractions are so useful that successful programmers are constantly inventing
 them, and incorporating them into their programs.<br>
Even the notion of being able to write an expression, instead of a series of
 separate arithmetic operations, is powerful. This notion was unusual enough
 when first introduced in the fifties that it formed the basis for the name of
 FORTRAN: Formula Translation.<br>
Treated abstractly, many data structures have notions of initialization and
 termination that extend well beyond mere memory allocation. For example, a data
 structure that represents a buffered output file must somehow incorporate the
 idea that the buffer must be flushed before the file is closed.

### Chapter 3 Living in the real world

APL is more than a language---its first implementation included an entire
 operating system as well. By modern standards, that system was astonishingly
 efficient.<br>
It doesn't matter how wonderful a programming language is if its programs won't
 run in your environment. If we have to live with a body of existing software,
 and we can't rewrite all the software to fit our favorite tools, we must choose
 tools that will coexist with the software.<br>
Thus, Lisp programmers are at a serious disadvantage when they have to deal with
 data that do not fit the S-expression model neatly. It is hard to write Lisp
 programs that deal with, say, magnetic tapes of census data, or with strange
 I/O devices such as local area networks or wind tunnels. I have met Lisp
 programmers who react to these disadvantages by arguing that the problems would
 go away if only the whole world used Lisp and noting else.<br>
But it gives C++ two extremely important attributes: portability and
 coexistence. If a machine supports C, there is no fundamental difficulty in
 getting it to support C++, which means that C++ can run almost anywhere.<br>
C++ thrives in mixed environments. It lives in the real world!
