## 0. Why Agent-Based Modeling?

Roman-to-Arabic numeracy (representational system) thought experiment ->
 current needs of understanding complex systems<br>
Emergence cannot be reduced to their sum or their difference. Emergence is the
 arising of novel and coherent structures, patterns, and properties through the
 interactions of multiple ditributed elements. It is with the absence of an
 orchestrator or centralized coordinator (self-organization), and needs not be
 deterministic (due to randomness).<br>
Most people fail to distinguish between the level of the individual elements
 and the level of system or aggregate patterns.<br>
we need ABM literacy. chemistry, biology, materials science -> psychology,
 sociology, physics, business, medicine -> economics, anthropology, philosophy,
 history, law
