Investors who early on saw potential in Internet stocks encountered the
 devastating dot-com bubble. Stock in Books-A-Million saw its price soar by over
 1,000 percent in one week simply by announcing it had an updated website.
 Subsequently, the price crashed and the company has since delisted and gone
 private.

## Part I WHAT

### Chapter 1. Bitcoin and the Financial Crisis of 2008

[Satoshi Nakamoto profile][satoshi_nakamoto_profile]<br>
[Bitcoin History][bitcoin_history]<br>
In the concluding paragraph of his foundational paper, Satoshi wrote: "We have
 proposed a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust."<br>
"Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper" thread ([1][satoshi_mail1], [2][satoshi_mail2],
 [3][satoshi_mail3], [4][satoshi_mail4])<br>
In the first instance of recording information on Bitcoin's blockchain, Satoshi
 inscribed: "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout of
 banks," in reference to [an article][the_times_article] that appeared in the
 British publication *The Times* on the U.K.'s likely need to assist more banks
 in staying afloat.<br>

### Chapter 2. The Basics of Bitcoin and Blockchain Technology

### Chapter 3. "Blockchain, Not Bitcoin?"

(private blockchains) Since these computers don't have to worry about attack
 from the outside---they are operating behind a firewall and collaborating with
 known entities---it removes the need for a native asset that incentivizes the
 build-out of a robust network of miners. A private blockchain is typically used
 to expedite and make existing processes more efficient, thereby rewarding the
 entities that have crafted the software and maintain the computers. In other
 words, the value creation is in the cost savings, and the entities that own the
 computers enjoy these savings.

### Chapter 4. The Taxonomy of Cryptoassets

We would not classify the majority of cryptoassets as currencies, but rather
 most are either digital commodities (*cryptocommodities*), provisioning raw
 digital resources, or digital tokens (*cryptotokens*), provisioning finished
 digital goods and services. Commodities are wide-ranging and most commonly
 thought of as raw material building blocks that serve as inputs into finished
 products. While compute, storage, and bandwidth are not yet widely referred to
 as commodities, they are building blocks that are arguably just as important as
 our physical commodities.<br>
A currency fulfills three well-defined purposes: to serve as a means of
 exchange, store of value, and unit of accout. However, the form of currency
 itself often has little inherent value.<br>
One of Bitcoin's most famous ancestors was pioneered by a company called
 DigiCash, led by David Chaum, who remains one of the most famous cryptographers
 in cryptoasset history. In 1993, prior to Marc Andressen founding Netscape,
 Chaum invented the digital payment system called ecash. This allowed secure and
 anonymous payments across the Internet, no matter the amount. Chaum refused
 Bill Gates, Netscape and Visa's offers. In 1998 it declared bankruptcy. Some
 players will resurface in our story, such as Nick Szabo, the father of "smart
 contracts," and Zooko Wilcox, the founder of Zcash, both of whom worked at
 DigiCash for a time. Other attempts were made at digital currencies, payment
 systems, or stores of value after ecash, like e-gold and Karma. The former ran
 into trouble with the FBI for serving a criminal element, while the latter
 never gained mainstream adoption.<br>
Ripple is a cryptocurrency created in 2004 by Ryan Fugger, a web developer from
 Vancouver. Fugger was searching for a way to allow communities to create a
 system of money out of chains of trust. If users didn't want to rely on these
 gateways, Ripple also had its own native cryptocurrency, called ripples, and
 commonly referred to as XRP. XRP could be used to connect two endpoints in the
 Ripple network that didn't have a connection of trust. Pricing services like
 CoinCap don't list XRP's total available supply as the 100 billion that Ripple
 lists but only include the ripple that has thus far been distributed to the
 public, which is just north of 37 billion units. Ripple has since pivoted away
 from being a transaction mechanism from the common person and instead now
 "enables banks to send real-time international payments across networks."<br>
Bitcoin transactions are *pseudonymous*. In order of launch, they are Dash,
 Monero, and Zcash.<br>
Monero is descendent of a lesser-known cryptocurrency called Bytecoin. Bytecoin
 was crafted quite differently from Bitcoin, using technology known as
 CryptoNote. Beyond a focus on more egalitarian proof-of-work, CryptoNote
 provided untraceable payments, unlinkable transactions, and blockchain analysis
 resistance. People were intrigued but confused about why the Bytecoin team had
 taken two years to make it public. Bytecoin planned to issue 184.46 billion
 bytecoin via the mining process, but by the time it was made publicly known,
 150 billion bytecoin were already in existence (premine), more than 80 percent
 of the total supply.<br>
The most defining feature of Monero is its use of *ring signatures*, a
 cryptographic technology that had been evolving since 1991. The statement
 proved by ring signatures is that the signer of a given message is a member of
 the group, but you will not be able to pinpoint the owner.<br>
(Dash) A crypto-currency based on Bitcoin with various improvements such as a
 two-tier incentivized network, known as the Masternode network. Included are
 other improvements such as Darksend, for increasing fungibility and InstantX
 which allows instant transaction confirmation without a centralized authority.
 Instead of a premine, it had what is called an *instamine*, where 1.9 million
 coins were created in the first 24 hours.<br>
From our perspective, if there is a major disruption or error in the launch of a
 cryptocurrency that significantly skews its distribution, then that
 cryptocurrency should be relaunched.<br>
A key innovation of Zcash is the use of a type of zero-knowledge proof, referred
 to as zk-SNARKs, which allow transactions to be sent between parties without
 any information being revealed other than the validity of the transaction.

### Chapter 5. Cryptocommodities and Cryptotokens

There are many other budding cryptocommodities, provisioning decentralized
 resources like cloud storage, bandwidth, transcoding, proxy re-encryption, and
 so on.<br>
Buterin was born in Russia but grew up in Canada. He had the good fortune of a
 freethinking father, who in February 2011 introduced 17-year-old Buterin to
 Satoshi's work and Bitcoin. Dmitry Buterin is also very much involved in the
 cryptoasset world as cofounder of Blockgeeks and other influential startups. He
 quickly became one of the first well-known journalists pioneering the world of
 cryptoassets, even cofounding *Bitcoin Magaine*, which remains one of the best
 deep dive sites for technical analyis of blockchain architectures. Hw as a
 Bronze medal winner at the International Olympiad in Informatics at the age of
 18 and could reportedly add three-digit numbers in his head at twice the speed
 of the average human being. In the months leading up to the development of
 Ethereum, I had the priviledge to work closely with several projects attempting
 to implement colored coins, smart property, and various types of decentralized
 exchange. In June 2014, Buterin received the
 [Thiel Fellowship][thiel_fellowship] as a 20-year-old dropping out of the
 University of Waterloo to pursue his interest in Ethereum on a full-time
 basis.<br>
Colored coins involve the marking of an address in Bitcoin with information
 beyond just the balance of bitcoin in that address. Further identifiers could
 also be appended to the address, such as information that represented ownership
 of a house. In transferring that bitcoin in that address to another address, so
 too went the marker of information about house ownership.<br>
Counterparty is a cryptocommodity that runs atop Bitcoin, and was launched in
 January 2014 with a smiliar intent as Ethereum. It has a fixed supply of 2.6
 million units of its native asset, XCP, which were all created upon launch. The
 reason Butcoin developers haven't added extra functionality and flexibility
 directly into its software is that they have prioritized sercurity over
 complexity.<br>
From July 23, 2014, to September 2, 2014, they staged a 42-day presale of ether.
 Ether was sold at a ranage of 1,337 to 2,000 ether per bitcoin. Overseeing the
 legal and financial nuances around this sale was the newly created Ethereum
 Foundation headquartered in Zug, Switzerland. Ethereum's fund-raising effort
 was not only innovative and timely, it was also record-breaking. The public
 invested 31,591 bitcoin, worth $18,439,086, for a total of 60,102,216
 ether---an implied rate of $0.31 per ether. Just over 9,000 people bought ether
 during the presale, placing the average initial investment at $2,000. In
 addition to the 60 million ether sold to the public, roughly 6 million was
 creaated to compensate early contributions to Ethereum, and another 6 million
 for long-term reserves of the Ethereum Foundation.<br>
We refer to many of these dApp native units as cryptotokens, while others refer
 to them as *appcoins*. While many dApps use a cryptotoken, the native units of
 some dApps should be classifed as a cryptocommodity layered on top of Ethereum,
 like Golem, which aims to be a supercomputer for compute intensive problems.
 The difference boils down to whether a raw digital resource is being
 provisioned (cryptocommodity) or if the dApp is providing a consumer-facing
 finished digital good or service (cryptotoken). Due to Ethereum's wild
 success, other decentalized world computers have popped up, such as Dfinity,
 Lisk, Rootstock, Tezos, Waves, and more.<br>
[State of the ÐApp][state_of_the_dapp], [Smart Contracts][smart_contracts]<br>
The creators of [The DAO][the_dao] ([GitHub][the_dao_github]) implemented a
 crowdfunding effort. Theirs surpassed the amount raised by Ethereum by nearly
 an order of magnitude, setting the record for the largest amount ever raised in
 this manner: over $168 million. The crowdfunding required that investments by
 made with ether, and because of this, by the end of the crowdfunding period The
 DAO team held 11.5 million ether, or 15 percent of all the ether created to
 that point. Less than three weeks later, on June 17, 2016, a major hack on The
 DAO was conducted that gained control of 3.6 million ether, one-third of the
 amount that had been committed to the project.<br>
[Ethereum Classic][ethereum_classic]<br>
Augur uses a cryptotoken, which it called Reputation (REP), to incentivize
 people to report on the outcomes of events truthfully. If holders fail to
 report accurately on the outcome of an event, or attempt to be dishonest---the
 Augur system redistributes the bad reporter's Reputation to those who have
 reported accurately during the same reporting cycle. A similar prediction
 market system, Gnosis, held a crowdsale in April 2017.<br>
Rootstock, similar to Counterparty, will have its own native currency called
 RSK. Sergio Lerner audited many aspects of the Bitcoin code. He now leads a
 team that is basically building Ethereum on Bitcoin, and the system will be
 compatible with all dApps that run on Ethereum.<br>
If one network is experiencing severe trouble, then a dApp can replicate its
 state on another similar platform, and from then on process all transactions
 through that platform.

## Part II WHY

### Chapter 6. The Importance of Portfolio Management and Alternative Assets

When evaluating any investment decision, the starting point is always an
 individual's financial goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance. Harry Max
 Markowitz's Nobel Prize winning effort created *modern portfolio theory* (MPT),
 which provides for the construction of investment porfolios that maximize
 expected returns based upon a targeted level of risk (*efficient frontier*).
 The key for any investor employing MPT is to explicitly consider risk.<br>
*Standard deviation of returns* is one of the most common measures of risk.<br>
The Sharpe ratio (from a Nobel Prize winner, William F. Sharpe) divides the
 average expected return of an asset (minus the risk-free rate) by its standard
 deviation of returns.<br>
One of the key breakthroughs of modern portfolio theory was to show that a
 riskier asset can be added to a portfolio, and if its behavior differs significantly from the preexisting assets in that portfolio, it can actually decrease the overall risk of the portfolio. The key is *correlation of returns*.<br>
Within the financial services industry, people talk abour risk in two ways:
 systematic and unsystematic. *Systematic risk* is the risk inherent to
 investing in assets subject to the effects of macroeconomic events---like
 global gross domestic product (GDP) growth, trade relations, warfare, and so
 on. It is also known as undiversifiable risk because all assets are affected by
 it. *Unsystematic risk*, on the other hand, is the risk specific to each
 individual investment, such as market sector, management, product expansion,
 geographic exposure, and so on. It is also known as *firm-specfic risk* and can
 be neutralized with a smartly constructed portfolio.<br>
Modern portfolio theory takes it a step further by saying over the long term,
 investors are rewarded *only* for the systematic risk they take on and will be
 adversely affected over the long run if they leave themselves exposed to
 unsystematic risk. The innovative investor recognizes that the overall risk of
 his portfolio can be reduced by including assets that are uncorrelated to the
 traditional capital markets, such as bitcoin and its digital siblings.

The financial crisis of 2008 caused many financial advisors and wealth managers
 to evaluate different approaches to portfolio construction other than solely
 stocks and bonds. Historically, one of the easiest ways to spot hedge funds has
 been their high fee structure. For example, many hedge funds operate under a 2
 and 20 model, or sometimes 3 and 30, where they charge a 2 percent annual
 management fee and take 20 percent of the profits from a year. Other common
 characteristics include their exclusivity and general secrecy.
