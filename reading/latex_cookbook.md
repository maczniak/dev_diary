## Chapter 1: The Variety of Document Types

[TeXworks][texworks] (editor), [Overleaf][overleaf] and
 [ShareLaTeX][sharelatex]<br>
We will use a class of the KOMA-Script ([manual][koma_script_manual]) bundle.
 This is a set of classes that were originally designed with the aim of
 replacing the standard classes and providing more features. KOMA-Script has
 been extensively developed during recent years. You can identify KOMA-Script
 classes and packages by the prefix `scr`. This prefix standas for **script**,
 which was the initial name of this bundle.<br>
In contrast with `\section*`, the `\addsec` command generates an entry in the
 table of contents.<br>
A very good source for checking the quality of a template is the guide to
 obsolete commands and packages in **LaTeX2e**, which is also called
 [**l2tabu**][l2tabu].<br>
The `ClassicThesis` ([manual][classicthesis_manual]) package by Prof. AndreÃÅ
 Miede is a thesis template of very good quality. The design follows the classic
 guide to writing, *The Elements of Typographic Style* by Robert Bringhurst.
 (don't use bold fonts, text body is not very wide, page number follows the
 title)<br>
You can use the `\includeonly` command to compile just the selected chapters for
 speeding up writing.<br>
`\xspace` inserts a space when there's no punctunation mark following it.<br>
[`inputenv`][inputenv], [`caption`][caption],
 [LaTeX Templates][latex_templates]<br>
The headings in sans serif font is an intentional default setting in KOMA-Script
 classes, which makes the headings lighter than the standard LaTeX big, bold,
 and serif headings.<br>
We chose the high-quality T1 supporting font set Latin Moderns by loading the
 `lmodern` package. We used the `microtype` package to get finder typography
 (better text justification).<br>
