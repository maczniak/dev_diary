The remarkable William Playfair (1759-1823) developed or improved upon nearly
 all the fundamental graphical designs, seeking to replace conventional tables
 of numbers with the systematic visual representations of his "linear
 arithmetic."

## PART I GRAPHICAL PRACTICE

### 1. Graphical Excellence

Data maps are usually described as "thematic maps" in cartography. The most
 extensive data maps, such as the cancer atlas and the count of the galaxies,
 place millions of bits of information on a single page before our eyes. No
 other method for the display of statistical information is so powerful.

The time-series plot is the most frequently used form of graphical design. With
 one dimension marching along to the regular rhythm of seconds, minutes, hours,
 days, weeks, months, years, centuries, or millennia, the natural ordering of
 the time scale gives this design a strength and efficiency of interpretation
 found in no other graphic arrangement.<br>
The two great inventors of modern graphical design were J. H. Lambert
 (1728-1777), a Swiss-German scientist and mathematician, and William Playfair
 (1759-1823), a Scottish political economist. The first known time-series using
 economic data was published in Playfair's remarkable book, *The Commercial and
 Political Atlas* (London, 1786). For Playfair, graphics were preferable to
 tables because graphics showed the shape of the data in a comparative
 perspective. Time-series plots did this, and all but one of the 44 charts in
 the first edition of *The Commercial and Political Atlas* were time-series.
 That one exception is the first known bar chart, which Playfair invented
 because year-to-year data were missing and he needed a design to portray the
 one-year data that were avaiable. Nonetheless he was skeptical about his
 innovation.

An especially effective device for enhancing the explanatory power of
 time-series displays is to add spatial dimensions to the design of the graphic,
 so that the data are moving over space (in two or three dimensions) as well as
 over time. ... viewers are hardly aware that they are looking into a world of
 four or five dimensions.<br>
The air pollution display is a *small multiple*. The same graphical design
 structure is repeated for each of the twelve slices or multiples.

One of four plates in *The Statistical Breviary*, this graphic is distinguished
 by its multivariate data, the use of area to depict quantity, and the pie
 chart--in apparently the first application of these devices.<br>
Data graghics, because they are relational and not tied to geographic or time
 coordinates, became relevant to all quantitative inquiry. Indeed, modern
 scientific literature, about 40 percent of published graphics have a relational
 form, with two or more variables (none of which are latitude, longitude, or
 time). This is no accident, since the relational graphic--in its barest form,
 the scatterplot and its variants--is the greatest of all graphical designs.

Graphical excellence consists of complex ideas communicated with clarity,
 precision, and efficiency.
