## 1. Introduction

TensorFlow is, in fact, a second-generation system for implementing and
 deploying deep neural networks at Google, succeeding the DistBelief project
 that started in 2011. TensorFlow was released to the public as an open source
 framework with an Apache 2.0 license in November 2015.<br>
TensorFlow comes with abstraction libraries such as Keras and TF-Slim, offering
 simplified high-level access to TensorFlow. Additionally, as we will see
 further along in this book, TensorFlow comes with many more features aimed at
 boosting scalability. These include support for asynchronous computation with
 threading and queues, efficient I/O and data formats, and much more.
