## 1. Introducing React

When building single-page apps, there are three major issues that you'll
 encounter:
* In a single-page application, the bulk of your time will be spent keeping your
  data in sync with your UI.
* Manipulating the DOM is really REALLY slow.
* Working with HTML templates can be a pain.

With React, you need to worry only about one thing: *the final state your UI is
 in*. React takes care of everything else.<br>
React is not a full-fledged framework that has an opinion on how everything in
 your app should behave. Instead, React works primarily in the View layer where
 all of its worries and concerns revolve around your visual elements and keeping
 them up to date. This means you are free to use whatever you want for the M and
 C part of your MVC architecture.<br>

## 2. Building Your First React App

To build a web app using React, we need a way to take our JSX and convert it
 into plain old JavaScript that your browser can understand.
* Set up a development environment around Node and a handful of build-tools.
* Let your browser rely on a JavaSCript library to automatically convert JSX to
  something it understands.
